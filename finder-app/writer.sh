# Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
#
# Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a
# file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as
# writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written
# within this file, referred to below as writestr
#
# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments
# above were not specified
#
# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content
# writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it
# doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file
# could not be created.
#
# Example:
#
# writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
#
# Creates file:
#
# /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
#
# With content:
#
# ios
